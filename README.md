# Gesture-controlled-robot-using-accelerometer
this is a simple bot which uses accelerometer and arduino for its control and can also be made wireless.
This main components are a motor driver, A RF module and a decoder, motors and a chasis.
the connections are the simple which are required to controll a motor from Arduino and the accelerometer is connected from A0-A5 pin of arduino.4
the connections for Rf module would be updated shortly.
